[ ] Continuation of ASA + Plavix vs initiation of anticoagulation with NOAC will be reevaluated in Neurology clinic appointment         Pending Results     None           Hospital Course   88M with PMHx of HTN, HLD, T2DM, CKD, found down on 1/4 w/ left-sided weakness, ED2CT called, NIHSS 4, distal R M1 thrombus, s/p tPA 1/4 20:14, now awaiting rehab.  He is legally blind with visual anosognosia consistent with Anton syndrome 88 y.o. male with a history of a. Fib (not on anticoagulation but on ASA and Plavix), HTN, HLD, T2DM, severe R>L vision loss due to glaucoma s/p recent OD surgical repair, CKD, presenting for transfer from the NICU after being found down 30 min after falling from bed with headstrike on bedstand, and  found to have a right MCA infarct now s/p tPA.  Â   On the day of admission (1/4) the patient's wife found him down after an unwitnessed fall from bed and headstrike on bedstand. He denies losing consciousness during the fall. The patient's wife reports that his left arm and leg were weak, his left hand was curled up, and he seemed confused. EMS was called and they then noted that he had L-sided weakness and neglect.   Â   Of note, two weeks prior to admission the patient had OD surgery for glaucoma and had complained of poor vision ever since. His wife notes that since the surgery, he was able to do basic tasks around the house but would bumble into the walls when walking, frequently complained at how ""dim"" the house was (though all lights on) and often did not notice when someone else was in the room until they spoke.   Â   On arrival to MGH ED on 1/4, his NIHSS = 4 (-1 orientation, -1 visual field, -1 sensory deficit, -1 neglect). NCHCT showed hyperdense R MCA sign without hemorrhage and CTA showed R M1 occlusion. He was hypertensive to 210/109 and needed IV labetalol, IV tPA was then administered (risks and benefits were discussed regarding the context of recent eye surgery). Having been stabilized in the NICU, the patient was then transferred to CMF service. F/u head CT post-tPA showed no hemorrhagic transformation, ASA was resumed but clopidogrel was not. Of note, an incidental dural AVF in the left ponto-cerebellar angle was suspected on CTA and later confirmed on MRA. This AVF was small and believed not to confer a significant increase in bleeding and management was deemed to be conservative. TTE showed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved EF and dilation of both atriums; the bubble study was not demonstrative of a PFO but there were late appearing bubbles from an agitated saline injection noted in the left heart most consistent with an intrapulmonary shunt      On clinical exam at CMF, the  most remarkable finding was a virtually complete bilateral blindness based on objective tests. We interpreted that this was a result of his baseline severe glaucoma with superimposed deficits from the parietal lesion, in the form of anosognosia of the previous visual deficit and a possible new left visual field cut. MEEI Ophthalmology was consulted to rule out ocular emboli or other acute pathology worsening baseline visual acuity, but two ophthalmologic exams done at different time-points  were not demonstrative of any other superimposed ocular pathologies. The patient was considered to be legally blind and with features of Anton syndrome.      Â   was continued on single antiplatelet treatment (ASA), statin, risk factor control, and post-stroke recovery efforts. Based on his very high risk for recurrent Afib-related stroke (CHADS2-VASc at least 6) there is a strong indication for switch from antiplatelet long-term to NOAC (apixaban) once the infarct matured. However, there is high uncertainty regarding the safety of this treatment in a patient at current high risk for fall and injuries; thus, the final decision regarding anticoagulation vs DAPT will be made accounting for his degree or recovery and supervision. Resolution of the Anton syndrome appears to be key to ensure a sufficiently safe context to start anticoagulation. The patient will be seen in Neurology Clinic in 2 months and indication for anticoagulation will be reassessed then. On discharge the patient is on DAPT (ASA+Plavix) and he should remain on it indefinitely if anticoagulation is finally considered an unsafe option in the long run (per ACTIVE-A trial).         The patient was noted to be growing 100,000 CFU/mL of Proteus in urine, for which he was treated with antibiotic for 1 week: initially ciprofloxacin and later Augmentine due to worsening renal function. Last dose given on.    The patient needed to be started on standing  Seroquel (25 mg at dinner time and 50 mg at night time) due to development of agitated delirium, with insomnia and impulsivity. The etiology is multifactorial and includes stroke, hospital admission, visual deprivation with perhaps superimposed hallucinations, and UTI. Apart from Seroquel his delirium improved with aggressive management including delirium precautions, frequent re-orientation and melatonin QHS. He is discharged to rehab facility to continue with recovery. Seroquel dose should be decreased progressively as the patient's sundowning improves.    During the last 24 hours of admission the patient has developed intense swelling, severe pain and tenderness around the third MCP joint of the right hand. He denies any direct trauma to the hand. Has no fever or leukocytosis. X-ray ruled out fracture, dislocation or signs of RA. The patient has a h/o gout and was on colchicine at home. Colchicine has been restarted and naproxen 500 BID will be administered for 2 days paying close attention to his renal function, since he had a creatinine bump during admission that needed extra IV hydration to normalize.

[ ] Continuation of ASA + Plavix vs initiation of anticoagulation with NOAC will be reevaluated in Neurology clinic appointment         Pending Results     None           Hospital Course   79M with PMHx of HTN, HLD, T2DM, CKD, found down on 1/4 w/ left-sided weakness, ED2CT called, NIHSS 4, distal R M1 thrombus, s/p tPA 1/4 20:14, now awaiting rehab.  He is legally blind with visual anosognosia consistent with Anton syndrome 79 y.o. male with a history of a. Fib (not on anticoagulation but on ASA and Plavix), HTN, HLD, T2DM, severe R>L vision loss due to glaucoma s/p recent OD surgical repair, CKD, presenting for transfer from the NICU after being found down 30 min after falling from bed with headstrike on bedstand, and  found to have a right MCA infarct now s/p tPA.  Â   On the day of admission (1/4) the patient's wife found him down after an unwitnessed fall from bed and headstrike on bedstand. He denies losing consciousness during the fall. The patient's wife reports that his left arm and leg were weak, his left hand was curled up, and he seemed confused. EMS was called and they then noted that he had L-sided weakness and neglect.   Â   Of note, two weeks prior to admission the patient had OD surgery for glaucoma and had complained of poor vision ever since. His wife notes that since the surgery, he was able to do basic tasks around the house but would bumble into the walls when walking, frequently complained at how ""dim"" the house was (though all lights on) and often did not notice when someone else was in the room until they spoke.   Â   On arrival to MGH ED on 1/4, his NIHSS = 4 (-1 orientation, -1 visual field, -1 sensory deficit, -1 neglect). NCHCT showed hyperdense R MCA sign without hemorrhage and CTA showed R M1 occlusion. He was hypertensive to 210/109 and needed IV labetalol, IV tPA was then administered (risks and benefits were discussed regarding the context of recent eye surgery). Having been stabilized in the NICU, the patient was then transferred to CMF service. F/u head CT post-tPA showed no hemorrhagic transformation, ASA was resumed but clopidogrel was not. Of note, an incidental dural AVF in the left ponto-cerebellar angle was suspected on CTA and later confirmed on MRA. This AVF was small and believed not to confer a significant increase in bleeding and management was deemed to be conservative. TTE showed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved EF and dilation of both atriums; the bubble study was not demonstrative of a PFO but there were late appearing bubbles from an agitated saline injection noted in the left heart most consistent with an intrapulmonary shunt      On clinical exam at CMF, the  most remarkable finding was a virtually complete bilateral blindness based on objective tests. We interpreted that this was a result of his baseline severe glaucoma with superimposed deficits from the parietal lesion, in the form of anosognosia of the previous visual deficit and a possible new left visual field cut. MEEI Ophthalmology was consulted to rule out ocular emboli or other acute pathology worsening baseline visual acuity, but two ophthalmologic exams done at different time-points  were not demonstrative of any other superimposed ocular pathologies. The patient was considered to be legally blind and with features of Anton syndrome.      Â   was continued on single antiplatelet treatment (ASA), statin, risk factor control, and post-stroke recovery efforts. Based on his very high risk for recurrent Afib-related stroke (CHADS2-VASc at least 6) there is a strong indication for switch from antiplatelet long-term to NOAC (apixaban) once the infarct matured. However, there is high uncertainty regarding the safety of this treatment in a patient at current high risk for fall and injuries; thus, the final decision regarding anticoagulation vs DAPT will be made accounting for his degree or recovery and supervision. Resolution of the Anton syndrome appears to be key to ensure a sufficiently safe context to start anticoagulation. The patient will be seen in Neurology Clinic in 2 months and indication for anticoagulation will be reassessed then. On discharge the patient is on DAPT (ASA+Plavix) and he should remain on it indefinitely if anticoagulation is finally considered an unsafe option in the long run (per ACTIVE-A trial).         The patient was noted to be growing 100,000 CFU/mL of Proteus in urine, for which he was treated with antibiotic for 1 week: initially ciprofloxacin and later Augmentine due to worsening renal function. Last dose given on.    The patient needed to be started on standing  Seroquel (25 mg at dinner time and 50 mg at night time) due to development of agitated delirium, with insomnia and impulsivity. The etiology is multifactorial and includes stroke, hospital admission, visual deprivation with perhaps superimposed hallucinations, and UTI. Apart from Seroquel his delirium improved with aggressive management including delirium precautions, frequent re-orientation and melatonin QHS. He is discharged to rehab facility to continue with recovery. Seroquel dose should be decreased progressively as the patient's sundowning improves.    During the last 24 hours of admission the patient has developed intense swelling, severe pain and tenderness around the third MCP joint of the right hand. He denies any direct trauma to the hand. Has no fever or leukocytosis. X-ray ruled out fracture, dislocation or signs of RA. The patient has a h/o gout and was on colchicine at home. Colchicine has been restarted and naproxen 500 BID will be administered for 2 days paying close attention to his renal function, since he had a creatinine bump during admission that needed extra IV hydration to normalize.

He is legally blind with visual anosognosia consistent with Anton syndrome 43 y.o. male with a history of a. Fib (not on anticoagulation but on ASA and Plavix), HTN, HLD, T2DM, severe R>L vision loss due to glaucoma s/p recent OD surgical repair, CKD, presenting for transfer from the NICU after being found down 30 min after falling from bed with headstrike on bedstand, and  found to have a right MCA infarct now s/p tPA.  Â   On the day of admission (1/4) the patient's wife found him down after an unwitnessed fall from bed and headstrike on bedstand. He denies losing consciousness during the fall. The patient's wife reports that his left arm and leg were weak, his left hand was curled up, and he seemed confused. EMS was called and they then noted that he had L-sided weakness and neglect.   Â   Of note, two weeks prior to admission the patient had OD surgery for glaucoma and had complained of poor vision ever since. His wife notes that since the surgery, he was able to do basic tasks around the house but would bumble into the walls when walking, frequently complained at how ""dim"" the house was (though all lights on) and often did not notice when someone else was in the room until they spoke.   Â   On arrival to MGH ED on 1/4, his NIHSS = 4 (-1 orientation, -1 visual field, -1 sensory deficit, -1 neglect). NCHCT showed hyperdense R MCA sign without hemorrhage and CTA showed R M1 occlusion. He was hypertensive to 210/109 and needed IV labetalol, IV tPA was then administered (risks and benefits were discussed regarding the context of recent eye surgery). Having been stabilized in the NICU, the patient was then transferred to CMF service. F/u head CT post-tPA showed no hemorrhagic transformation, ASA was resumed but clopidogrel was not. Of note, an incidental dural AVF in the left ponto-cerebellar angle was suspected on CTA and later confirmed on MRA. This AVF was small and believed not to confer a significant increase in bleeding and management was deemed to be conservative. TTE showed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved EF and dilation of both atriums; the bubble study was not demonstrative of a PFO but there were late appearing bubbles from an agitated saline injection noted in the left heart most consistent with an intrapulmonary shunt      On clinical exam at CMF, the  most remarkable finding was a virtually complete bilateral blindness based on objective tests. We interpreted that this was a result of his baseline severe glaucoma with superimposed deficits from the parietal lesion, in the form of anosognosia of the previous visual deficit and a possible new left visual field cut. MEEI Ophthalmology was consulted to rule out ocular emboli or other acute pathology worsening baseline visual acuity, but two ophthalmologic exams done at different time-points  were not demonstrative of any other superimposed ocular pathologies. The patient was considered to be legally blind and with features of Anton syndrome.      Â   was continued on single antiplatelet treatment (ASA), statin, risk factor control, and post-stroke recovery efforts. Based on his very high risk for recurrent Afib-related stroke (CHADS2-VASc at least 6) there is a strong indication for switch from antiplatelet long-term to NOAC (apixaban) once the infarct matured. However, there is high uncertainty regarding the safety of this treatment in a patient at current high risk for fall and injuries; thus, the final decision regarding anticoagulation vs DAPT will be made accounting for his degree or recovery and supervision. Resolution of the Anton syndrome appears to be key to ensure a sufficiently safe context to start anticoagulation. The patient will be seen in Neurology Clinic in 2 months and indication for anticoagulation will be reassessed then. On discharge the patient is on DAPT (ASA+Plavix) and he should remain on it indefinitely if anticoagulation is finally considered an unsafe option in the long run (per ACTIVE-A trial).         The patient was noted to be growing 100,000 CFU/mL of Proteus in urine, for which he was treated with antibiotic for 1 week: initially ciprofloxacin and later Augmentine due to worsening renal function. Last dose given on.    The patient needed to be started on standing  Seroquel (25 mg at dinner time and 50 mg at night time) due to development of agitated delirium, with insomnia and impulsivity. The etiology is multifactorial and includes stroke, hospital admission, visual deprivation with perhaps superimposed hallucinations, and UTI. Apart from Seroquel his delirium improved with aggressive management including delirium precautions, frequent re-orientation and melatonin QHS. He is discharged to rehab facility to continue with recovery. Seroquel dose should be decreased progressively as the patient's sundowning improves.    During the last 24 hours of admission the patient has developed intense swelling, severe pain and tenderness around the third MCP joint of the right hand. He denies any direct trauma to the hand. Has no fever or leukocytosis. X-ray ruled out fracture, dislocation or signs of RA. The patient has a h/o gout and was on colchicine at home. Colchicine has been restarted and naproxen 500 BID will be administered for 2 days paying close attention to his renal function, since he had a creatinine bump during admission that needed extra IV hydration to normalize.

[ ] Continuation of ASA + Plavix vs initiation of anticoagulation with NOAC will be reevaluated in Neurology clinic appointment         Pending Results     None           Hospital Course   55M with PMHx of HTN, HLD, T2DM, CKD, found down on 1/4 w/ left-sided weakness, ED2CT called, NIHSS 4, distal R M1 thrombus, s/p tPA 1/4 20:14, now awaiting rehab.  He is legally blind with visual anosognosia consistent with Anton syndrome 55 y.o. male with a history of a. Fib (not on anticoagulation but on ASA and Plavix), HTN, HLD, T2DM, severe R>L vision loss due to glaucoma s/p recent OD surgical repair, CKD, presenting for transfer from the NICU after being found down 30 min after falling from bed with headstrike on bedstand, and  found to have a right MCA infarct now s/p tPA.  Â   On the day of admission (1/4) the patient's wife found him down after an unwitnessed fall from bed and headstrike on bedstand. He denies losing consciousness during the fall. The patient's wife reports that his left arm and leg were weak, his left hand was curled up, and he seemed confused. EMS was called and they then noted that he had L-sided weakness and neglect.   Â   Of note, two weeks prior to admission the patient had OD surgery for glaucoma and had complained of poor vision ever since. His wife notes that since the surgery, he was able to do basic tasks around the house but would bumble into the walls when walking, frequently complained at how ""dim"" the house was (though all lights on) and often did not notice when someone else was in the room until they spoke.   Â   On arrival to MGH ED on 1/4, his NIHSS = 4 (-1 orientation, -1 visual field, -1 sensory deficit, -1 neglect). NCHCT showed hyperdense R MCA sign without hemorrhage and CTA showed R M1 occlusion. He was hypertensive to 210/109 and needed IV labetalol, IV tPA was then administered (risks and benefits were discussed regarding the context of recent eye surgery). Having been stabilized in the NICU, the patient was then transferred to CMF service. F/u head CT post-tPA showed no hemorrhagic transformation, ASA was resumed but clopidogrel was not. Of note, an incidental dural AVF in the left ponto-cerebellar angle was suspected on CTA and later confirmed on MRA. This AVF was small and believed not to confer a significant increase in bleeding and management was deemed to be conservative. TTE showed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved EF and dilation of both atriums; the bubble study was not demonstrative of a PFO but there were late appearing bubbles from an agitated saline injection noted in the left heart most consistent with an intrapulmonary shunt      On clinical exam at CMF, the  most remarkable finding was a virtually complete bilateral blindness based on objective tests. We interpreted that this was a result of his baseline severe glaucoma with superimposed deficits from the parietal lesion, in the form of anosognosia of the previous visual deficit and a possible new left visual field cut. MEEI Ophthalmology was consulted to rule out ocular emboli or other acute pathology worsening baseline visual acuity, but two ophthalmologic exams done at different time-points  were not demonstrative of any other superimposed ocular pathologies. The patient was considered to be legally blind and with features of Anton syndrome.      Â   was continued on single antiplatelet treatment (ASA), statin, risk factor control, and post-stroke recovery efforts. Based on his very high risk for recurrent Afib-related stroke (CHADS2-VASc at least 6) there is a strong indication for switch from antiplatelet long-term to NOAC (apixaban) once the infarct matured. However, there is high uncertainty regarding the safety of this treatment in a patient at current high risk for fall and injuries; thus, the final decision regarding anticoagulation vs DAPT will be made accounting for his degree or recovery and supervision. Resolution of the Anton syndrome appears to be key to ensure a sufficiently safe context to start anticoagulation. The patient will be seen in Neurology Clinic in 2 months and indication for anticoagulation will be reassessed then. On discharge the patient is on DAPT (ASA+Plavix) and he should remain on it indefinitely if anticoagulation is finally considered an unsafe option in the long run (per ACTIVE-A trial).         The patient was noted to be growing 100,000 CFU/mL of Proteus in urine, for which he was treated with antibiotic for 1 week: initially ciprofloxacin and later Augmentine due to worsening renal function. Last dose given on.    The patient needed to be started on standing  Seroquel (25 mg at dinner time and 50 mg at night time) due to development of agitated delirium, with insomnia and impulsivity. The etiology is multifactorial and includes stroke, hospital admission, visual deprivation with perhaps superimposed hallucinations, and UTI. Apart from Seroquel his delirium improved with aggressive management including delirium precautions, frequent re-orientation and melatonin QHS. He is discharged to rehab facility to continue with recovery. Seroquel dose should be decreased progressively as the patient's sundowning improves.    During the last 24 hours of admission the patient has developed intense swelling, severe pain and tenderness around the third MCP joint of the right hand. He denies any direct trauma to the hand. Has no fever or leukocytosis. X-ray ruled out fracture, dislocation or signs of RA. The patient has a h/o gout and was on colchicine at home. Colchicine has been restarted and naproxen 500 BID will be administered for 2 days paying close attention to his renal function, since he had a creatinine bump during admission that needed extra IV hydration to normalize.

He is legally blind with visual anosognosia consistent with Anton syndrome 60 y.o. female with a history of a. Fib (not on anticoagulation but on ASA and Plavix), HTN, HLD, T2DM, severe R>L vision loss due to glaucoma s/p recent OD surgical repair, CKD, presenting for transfer from the NICU after being found down 30 min after falling from bed with headstrike on bedstand, and  found to have a right MCA infarct now s/p tPA.  Â   On the day of admission (1/4) the patient's wife found him down after an unwitnessed fall from bed and headstrike on bedstand. He denies losing consciousness during the fall. The patient's wife reports that his left arm and leg were weak, his left hand was curled up, and he seemed confused. EMS was called and they then noted that he had L-sided weakness and neglect.   Â   Of note, two weeks prior to admission the patient had OD surgery for glaucoma and had complained of poor vision ever since. His wife notes that since the surgery, he was able to do basic tasks around the house but would bumble into the walls when walking, frequently complained at how ""dim"" the house was (though all lights on) and often did not notice when someone else was in the room until they spoke.   Â   On arrival to MGH ED on 1/4, his NIHSS = 4 (-1 orientation, -1 visual field, -1 sensory deficit, -1 neglect). NCHCT showed hyperdense R MCA sign without hemorrhage and CTA showed R M1 occlusion. He was hypertensive to 210/109 and needed IV labetalol, IV tPA was then administered (risks and benefits were discussed regarding the context of recent eye surgery). Having been stabilized in the NICU, the patient was then transferred to CMF service. F/u head CT post-tPA showed no hemorrhagic transformation, ASA was resumed but clopidogrel was not. Of note, an incidental dural AVF in the left ponto-cerebellar angle was suspected on CTA and later confirmed on MRA. This AVF was small and believed not to confer a significant increase in bleeding and management was deemed to be conservative. TTE showed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved EF and dilation of both atriums; the bubble study was not demonstrative of a PFO but there were late appearing bubbles from an agitated saline injection noted in the left heart most consistent with an intrapulmonary shunt      On clinical exam at CMF, the  most remarkable finding was a virtually complete bilateral blindness based on objective tests. We interpreted that this was a result of his baseline severe glaucoma with superimposed deficits from the parietal lesion, in the form of anosognosia of the previous visual deficit and a possible new left visual field cut. MEEI Ophthalmology was consulted to rule out ocular emboli or other acute pathology worsening baseline visual acuity, but two ophthalmologic exams done at different time-points  were not demonstrative of any other superimposed ocular pathologies. The patient was considered to be legally blind and with features of Anton syndrome.      Â   was continued on single antiplatelet treatment (ASA), statin, risk factor control, and post-stroke recovery efforts. Based on his very high risk for recurrent Afib-related stroke (CHADS2-VASc at least 6) there is a strong indication for switch from antiplatelet long-term to NOAC (apixaban) once the infarct matured. However, there is high uncertainty regarding the safety of this treatment in a patient at current high risk for fall and injuries; thus, the final decision regarding anticoagulation vs DAPT will be made accounting for his degree or recovery and supervision. Resolution of the Anton syndrome appears to be key to ensure a sufficiently safe context to start anticoagulation. The patient will be seen in Neurology Clinic in 2 months and indication for anticoagulation will be reassessed then. On discharge the patient is on DAPT (ASA+Plavix) and he should remain on it indefinitely if anticoagulation is finally considered an unsafe option in the long run (per ACTIVE-A trial).         The patient was noted to be growing 100,000 CFU/mL of Proteus in urine, for which he was treated with antibiotic for 1 week: initially ciprofloxacin and later Augmentine due to worsening renal function. Last dose given on.    The patient needed to be started on standing  Seroquel (25 mg at dinner time and 50 mg at night time) due to development of agitated delirium, with insomnia and impulsivity. The etiology is multifactorial and includes stroke, hospital admission, visual deprivation with perhaps superimposed hallucinations, and UTI. Apart from Seroquel his delirium improved with aggressive management including delirium precautions, frequent re-orientation and melatonin QHS. He is discharged to rehab facility to continue with recovery. Seroquel dose should be decreased progressively as the patient's sundowning improves.    During the last 24 hours of admission the patient has developed intense swelling, severe pain and tenderness around the third MCP joint of the right hand. He denies any direct trauma to the hand. Has no fever or leukocytosis. X-ray ruled out fracture, dislocation or signs of RA. The patient has a h/o gout and was on colchicine at home. Colchicine has been restarted and naproxen 500 BID will be administered for 2 days paying close attention to his renal function, since he had a creatinine bump during admission that needed extra IV hydration to normalize.

Â   was continued on single antiplatelet treatment (ASA), statin, risk factor control, and post-stroke recovery efforts. Based on his very high risk for recurrent Afib-related stroke (CHADS2-VASc at least 6) there is a strong indication for switch from antiplatelet long-term to NOAC (apixaban) once the infarct matured. However, there is high uncertainty regarding the safety of this treatment in a patient at current high risk for fall and injuries; thus, the final decision regarding anticoagulation vs DAPT will be made accounting for his degree or recovery and supervision. Resolution of the Anton syndrome appears to be key to ensure a sufficiently safe context to start anticoagulation. The patient will be seen in Neurology Clinic in 2 months and indication for anticoagulation will be reassessed then. On discharge the patient is on DAPT (ASA+Plavix) and he should remain on it indefinitely if anticoagulation is finally considered an unsafe option in the long run (per ACTIVE-A trial).         The patient was noted to be growing 100,000 CFU/mL of Proteus in urine, for which he was treated with antibiotic for 1 week: initially ciprofloxacin and later Augmentine due to worsening renal function. Last dose given on.    The patient needed to be started on standing  Seroquel (25 mg at dinner time and 50 mg at night time) due to development of agitated delirium, with insomnia and impulsivity. The etiology is multifactorial and includes stroke, hospital admission, visual deprivation with perhaps superimposed hallucinations, and UTI. Apart from Seroquel his delirium improved with aggressive management including delirium precautions, frequent re-orientation and melatonin QHS. He is discharged to rehab facility to continue with recovery. Seroquel dose should be decreased progressively as the patient's sundowning improves.    During the last 24 hours of admission the patient has developed intense swelling, severe pain and tenderness around the third MCP joint of the right hand. He denies any direct trauma to the hand. Has no fever or leukocytosis. X-ray ruled out fracture, dislocation or signs of RA. The patient has a h/o gout and was on colchicine at home. Colchicine has been restarted and naproxen 500 BID will be administered for 2 days paying close attention to his renal function, since he had a creatinine bump during admission that needed extra IV hydration to normalize.

He is legally blind with visual anosognosia consistent with Anton syndrome 67 y.o. female with a history of a. Fib (not on anticoagulation but on ASA and Plavix), HTN, HLD, T2DM, severe R>L vision loss due to glaucoma s/p recent OD surgical repair, CKD, presenting for transfer from the NICU after being found down 30 min after falling from bed with headstrike on bedstand, and  found to have a right MCA infarct now s/p tPA.  Â   On the day of admission (1/4) the patient's wife found him down after an unwitnessed fall from bed and headstrike on bedstand. He denies losing consciousness during the fall. The patient's wife reports that his left arm and leg were weak, his left hand was curled up, and he seemed confused. EMS was called and they then noted that he had L-sided weakness and neglect.   Â   Of note, two weeks prior to admission the patient had OD surgery for glaucoma and had complained of poor vision ever since. His wife notes that since the surgery, he was able to do basic tasks around the house but would bumble into the walls when walking, frequently complained at how ""dim"" the house was (though all lights on) and often did not notice when someone else was in the room until they spoke.   Â   On arrival to MGH ED on 1/4, his NIHSS = 4 (-1 orientation, -1 visual field, -1 sensory deficit, -1 neglect). NCHCT showed hyperdense R MCA sign without hemorrhage and CTA showed R M1 occlusion. He was hypertensive to 210/109 and needed IV labetalol, IV tPA was then administered (risks and benefits were discussed regarding the context of recent eye surgery). Having been stabilized in the NICU, the patient was then transferred to CMF service. F/u head CT post-tPA showed no hemorrhagic transformation, ASA was resumed but clopidogrel was not. Of note, an incidental dural AVF in the left ponto-cerebellar angle was suspected on CTA and later confirmed on MRA. This AVF was small and believed not to confer a significant increase in bleeding and management was deemed to be conservative. TTE showed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved EF and dilation of both atriums; the bubble study was not demonstrative of a PFO but there were late appearing bubbles from an agitated saline injection noted in the left heart most consistent with an intrapulmonary shunt      On clinical exam at CMF, the  most remarkable finding was a virtually complete bilateral blindness based on objective tests. We interpreted that this was a result of his baseline severe glaucoma with superimposed deficits from the parietal lesion, in the form of anosognosia of the previous visual deficit and a possible new left visual field cut. MEEI Ophthalmology was consulted to rule out ocular emboli or other acute pathology worsening baseline visual acuity, but two ophthalmologic exams done at different time-points  were not demonstrative of any other superimposed ocular pathologies. The patient was considered to be legally blind and with features of Anton syndrome.

[ ] Continuation of ASA + Plavix vs initiation of anticoagulation with NOAC will be reevaluated in Neurology clinic appointment         Pending Results     None           Hospital Course   65F with PMHx of HTN, HLD, T2DM, CKD, found down on 1/4 w/ left-sided weakness, ED2CT called, NIHSS 4, distal R M1 thrombus, s/p tPA 1/4 20:14, now awaiting rehab.  He is legally blind with visual anosognosia consistent with Anton syndrome 65 y.o. female with a history of a. Fib (not on anticoagulation but on ASA and Plavix), HTN, HLD, T2DM, severe R>L vision loss due to glaucoma s/p recent OD surgical repair, CKD, presenting for transfer from the NICU after being found down 30 min after falling from bed with headstrike on bedstand, and  found to have a right MCA infarct now s/p tPA.  Â   On the day of admission (1/4) the patient's wife found him down after an unwitnessed fall from bed and headstrike on bedstand. He denies losing consciousness during the fall. The patient's wife reports that his left arm and leg were weak, his left hand was curled up, and he seemed confused. EMS was called and they then noted that he had L-sided weakness and neglect.   Â   Of note, two weeks prior to admission the patient had OD surgery for glaucoma and had complained of poor vision ever since. His wife notes that since the surgery, he was able to do basic tasks around the house but would bumble into the walls when walking, frequently complained at how ""dim"" the house was (though all lights on) and often did not notice when someone else was in the room until they spoke.   Â   On arrival to MGH ED on 1/4, his NIHSS = 4 (-1 orientation, -1 visual field, -1 sensory deficit, -1 neglect). NCHCT showed hyperdense R MCA sign without hemorrhage and CTA showed R M1 occlusion. He was hypertensive to 210/109 and needed IV labetalol, IV tPA was then administered (risks and benefits were discussed regarding the context of recent eye surgery). Having been stabilized in the NICU, the patient was then transferred to CMF service. F/u head CT post-tPA showed no hemorrhagic transformation, ASA was resumed but clopidogrel was not. Of note, an incidental dural AVF in the left ponto-cerebellar angle was suspected on CTA and later confirmed on MRA. This AVF was small and believed not to confer a significant increase in bleeding and management was deemed to be conservative. TTE showed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved EF and dilation of both atriums; the bubble study was not demonstrative of a PFO but there were late appearing bubbles from an agitated saline injection noted in the left heart most consistent with an intrapulmonary shunt      On clinical exam at CMF, the  most remarkable finding was a virtually complete bilateral blindness based on objective tests. We interpreted that this was a result of his baseline severe glaucoma with superimposed deficits from the parietal lesion, in the form of anosognosia of the previous visual deficit and a possible new left visual field cut. MEEI Ophthalmology was consulted to rule out ocular emboli or other acute pathology worsening baseline visual acuity, but two ophthalmologic exams done at different time-points  were not demonstrative of any other superimposed ocular pathologies. The patient was considered to be legally blind and with features of Anton syndrome.      Â   was continued on single antiplatelet treatment (ASA), statin, risk factor control, and post-stroke recovery efforts. Based on his very high risk for recurrent Afib-related stroke (CHADS2-VASc at least 6) there is a strong indication for switch from antiplatelet long-term to NOAC (apixaban) once the infarct matured. However, there is high uncertainty regarding the safety of this treatment in a patient at current high risk for fall and injuries; thus, the final decision regarding anticoagulation vs DAPT will be made accounting for his degree or recovery and supervision. Resolution of the Anton syndrome appears to be key to ensure a sufficiently safe context to start anticoagulation. The patient will be seen in Neurology Clinic in 2 months and indication for anticoagulation will be reassessed then. On discharge the patient is on DAPT (ASA+Plavix) and he should remain on it indefinitely if anticoagulation is finally considered an unsafe option in the long run (per ACTIVE-A trial).         The patient was noted to be growing 100,000 CFU/mL of Proteus in urine, for which he was treated with antibiotic for 1 week: initially ciprofloxacin and later Augmentine due to worsening renal function. Last dose given on.    The patient needed to be started on standing  Seroquel (25 mg at dinner time and 50 mg at night time) due to development of agitated delirium, with insomnia and impulsivity. The etiology is multifactorial and includes stroke, hospital admission, visual deprivation with perhaps superimposed hallucinations, and UTI. Apart from Seroquel his delirium improved with aggressive management including delirium precautions, frequent re-orientation and melatonin QHS. He is discharged to rehab facility to continue with recovery. Seroquel dose should be decreased progressively as the patient's sundowning improves.    During the last 24 hours of admission the patient has developed intense swelling, severe pain and tenderness around the third MCP joint of the right hand. He denies any direct trauma to the hand. Has no fever or leukocytosis. X-ray ruled out fracture, dislocation or signs of RA. The patient has a h/o gout and was on colchicine at home. Colchicine has been restarted and naproxen 500 BID will be administered for 2 days paying close attention to his renal function, since he had a creatinine bump during admission that needed extra IV hydration to normalize.
